# Mume with litvis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gicentre/mume-with-litvis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gicentre/mume-with-litvis)

This project is a fork of [`mume`](https://github.com/shd101wyy/mume), which is the cor library behind for [Markdown Preview Enhanced for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) and [Markdown Preview Enhanced for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced#review-details).
Most of the code in this fork is inherited from the upstream repository and is thus courtesy of [@shd101wyy](https://github.com/shd101wyy) and other [contributors](https://github.com/shd101wyy/mume/graphs/contributors) to `mume`.

The fork produces an npm module called [`mume-with-litvis`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mume-with-litvis), which enables _Literate Visualisation_ ([litvis](http://litvis.org/)) in rendered markdown previews.

Litvis functionality has been designed and developed at [giCentre](https://www.gicentre.net/) by [Jo Wood](https://github.com/jwoLondon), [Alexander Kachkaev](https://github.com/kachkaev) and [Jason Dykes](https://github.com/jsndyks).
This research was in part supported by the EU under the EC Grant Agreement No. FP7-IP-608142 to Project [VALCRI](http://valcri.org/).
